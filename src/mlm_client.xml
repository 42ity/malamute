    <method name = "subscribe">
    Subscribe to all messages sent to matching addresses. The pattern is a
    regular expression using the CZMQ zrex syntax. The most useful elements
    are: ^ and $ to match the start and end, . to match any character,
    \s and \S to match whitespace and non-whitespace, \d and \D to match a
    digit and non-digit, \a and \A to match alphabetic and non-alphabetic,
    \w and \W to match alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric, + for one or more
    repetitions, * for zero or more repetitions, and ( ) to create groups.
    Returns 0 if subscription was successful, else -1.
