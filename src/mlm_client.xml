    Consume messages with a matching addresses. The pattern is a regular

    \S to match whitespace and non-whitespace, \d and \D to match a digit
    and non-digit, \a and \A to match alphabetic and non-alphabetic, \w
    and \W to match alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric, + for one or more
    repetitions, * for zero or more repetitions, and ( ) to create groups.
    Returns 0 if subscription was successful, else -1.
